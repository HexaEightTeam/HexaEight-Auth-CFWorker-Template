"# HexaEight-Auth-CFWorker-Template" 
# `HexaEight Authentication template using CloudFlare Workers`

A template for implementing HexaEight Quick Authentication with a Public DataSink

[`index.js`](https://github.com/HexaEightTeam/HexaEight-Auth-CFWorker-Template/blob/main/index.js) contains the Worker Script

#### Wrangler

This template requires [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler).

Proceed to the next steps after installing wrangler.

Install This Worker Template using the below steps:

#### 1. Create your worker. Change the yourworkername to name of your choice. 

>wrangler generate yourworkername https://github.com/HexaEightTeam/HexaEight-Auth-CFWorker-Template

#### 2. Create a KV namespace to store API Keys

>wrangler kv:namespace create "APIKeys"
> Creating namespace with title "<yourworkername>-APIKeys"
> Success!
>Add the following to your configuration file:
>kv_namespaces = [
>         { binding = "APIKeys", id = "<An ID gets generated here>" }
>]

Make note of the above id, this is required in step 3

#### 3. Edit wranger.toml and change the below to match your cloudflare account

>account_id = "<your cloudflare account id"
>routes = ["*.yourdomain.com/login*"] - Implements authentication for all subdomains under yourdomain.com
>zone_id = "yourzoneid"

>kv_namespaces = [
>         { binding = "APIKeys", id = "<put the KV ID generated in Step 2>" }
>]

>[vars]
>datasinkprotocol = "https" - Change this if you need to set a different protocol for datasink otherwise leave it as it is.
>datasink = "api.cl1p.net" - Change this if you want to use a different private or public datasink, no http or https, just datasinkname
>cookiedomain = ".yourdomain.com"  - Prefix a dot to allow a cookie to be set for all you subdomains

Save this File

#### 4. Get an API Key for HexaEight Secure Platform from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hexaeight-hexaeight-default/api/hexaeight-sso-platform/pricing)

A Free Plan is available if you want to test the authentication. Once you have subscribed to a plan, your Rapid API key is available 
@
[Rapid API Dashboard](https://rapidapi.com/developer/dashboard) --> Choose the default application --> Security on the left hand pane --> Application Key
Copy the API Key and 

Run the below command to save your API Key as a secret inside Cloud Flare

>wrangler kv:key put --binding=APIKeys "RapidAPIKey" "your-Rapid-api-Key"

#### 5. That is it!! Publish your worker
>wrangler publish

Lastly publish static web pages in your domain or subdomains and point the redirction url to your application.
